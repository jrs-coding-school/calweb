This demo is part of a series of demos to recreate the same functionality using different frameworks.

## Angular Flavor

Angular, a popular MVC framework is used across enterprise and business to power frontends of many applications.  With a new take on enhanced html, angular allows you to create custom markup with powerful behaviors while offering, out of the box, much of what you need to create a web application without the need to look elsewhere.  Of course, this could be a blessing or a curse, but for prototyping, it's definitely an advantage, as it allows a quick ramp up and a large api of things you'll need in an app.
